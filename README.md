# Face-Detection-with-MTCNN
Face detection is a computer vision problem that involves finding faces in photos.

It is a trivial problem for humans to solve and has been solved reasonably well by classical feature-based techniques, such as the cascade classifier. More recently deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark face detection datasets. One example is the Multi-task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network, or MTCNN for short.

## What is MTCNN
MTCNN is a python (pip) library written by Github user ipacz, which implements the paper Zhang, Kaipeng et al. “Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks.” IEEE Signal Processing Letters 23.10 (2016): 1499–1503. Crossref. Web.
